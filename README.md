Pontoon
=======
This is a proof-of-concept implementation of an in-place website localization tool, as [outlined by Austin King][outline]. Please note that Pontoon is in a very early alpha version, under heavy development, and unlikely to do much out of the box. If you are interested in the technology, feel free to step by `#pontoon` on <irc://irc.mozilla.org> or get more information from a [wiki][wiki].

Pontoon.jpg contains a schema of the application's components.

Usage
-----
Web client:

* Map / on a web server to the root of this project.
* Point your browser to /.
* Click on the Test Pilot link (Make sure you have Gettext support installed on your web server).

Django server ([Django][django] is required):

* `cd server`
* `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`

Update hostnames as needed:

* client/lib/js/pontoon.js - 127.0.0.1:8000 - change to server hostname and port
* hook/php/pontoon.php - 8000 - change port number

To use Microsoft Translator API for machine translation, obtain a valid API key from the [Bing Developer Center][bdc] and store it in a variable Pontoon.client._mt in your local settings file in client/lib/js/local-settings.js.
